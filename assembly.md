# Assembly Guide

This is (an optional) assembly guide that attempts to make the assembly process easier by dividing it into several steps, on each step a small section of the computer is built and tested, and any mistakes fixed.

The hope is to make debugging hardware mistakes easier, as well as give the builder a better understanding of the system and how it works.
